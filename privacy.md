# Privacy Policy for YouTube Description Rewriter

Effective Date: 30.03.2025

## Introduction

Thank you for using YouTube Description Rewriter. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Data Collected Automatically
- **Non-personal data**: We may collect non-personal information such as error logs and usage statistics to improve the extension's functionality.
- **YouTube page content**: The extension processes YouTube video descriptions locally in your browser to clean and rewrite them. This data is not transmitted to our servers.

### 2. User-Provided Data
- **API Keys**: If you use AI backends (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI ChatGPT), you may provide API keys. These keys are stored locally in your browser's synchronized storage and are not shared with us.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Local Processing**: All description cleaning and rewriting occur locally in your browser or via the APIs you configure.
- **Third-Party APIs**: If you enable AI backends, your YouTube description data may be sent to third-party services (e.g., OpenAI, Google) for processing. Please review their privacy policies for more details.

## Data Sharing

We do not collect or share your personal data. However, if you use third-party AI services, your data may be shared with those services as per their terms and policies.

## Data Security

- No data is transmitted to our servers.

## Your Choices

- You can disable AI backends and use the "Simple" mode, which processes descriptions locally without sending data to third-party services.
- You can delete your API keys at any time from the extension's settings.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
